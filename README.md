# EC530_Project2 -- DIY ML

# About

This project aims to explore the development of APIs through the implementation of a "do it yourself" machine learning framework.

Users will be able to upload their own image collections, select a model, and train the model to do image recognition all through the API.

Once their model is trained, users will be able to carry out inferences with uploaded images and obtain reports on their models' accuracy as well as other statistics.
